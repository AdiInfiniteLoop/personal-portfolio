            My coding journey began with <strong>Python</strong> during my early years in programming. 
            The simplicity and elegance of the language fascinated me, and the minor FizzBuzz Problem 
            soon turned into a deep passion for software development. As I explored further, I became 
            intrigued by <strong>problem-solving and algorithmic challenges</strong>, which led me to dive into 
            competitive programming and full-stack development.
            <br /><br />
            Currently, I am a <strong>Computer Science student</strong> at <strong>The National Institute of Engineering, Mysore</strong> 
            (CGPA: <strong>9.47</strong>), where I continue honing my skills in software engineering, web development, 
            and open-source contributions.
            <br /><br />
            I have worked as a <strong>Frontend Engineer Intern</strong> at <strong>Minervaa</strong>, building scalable web applications, 
            and as the <strong>Technical Co-Lead</strong> at <strong>OWASP NIE</strong>, where I organized cybersecurity events and led 
            open-source projects. My dedication to coding also reflects in my competitive programming journey, where 
            I have achieved the <strong>Knight rank</strong> on <strong>LeetCode</strong>, placing within the <strong>top 5.81%</strong> globally.
